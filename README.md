# VocalWarmup
If you don't have a piano, this MATLAB script will play vocal warmups for you.

How To Use:

After cloning the repo, add the repo directory to your MATLAB path.

At the MATLAB prompt, type:

  >>> GenerateTonesEqTemp
  
and MATLAB will play audio for you. 

Great for guitarists & other folks who might not have a piano (I currently do not, which is why I wrote this).

* Pull Requests Welcome!

* This version uses equal temperment. I plan on making a version that supports perfect tuning
  (aka Just Intonation) but if that sounds like fun to you go for it.
  
* Adding Harmonics
  This version uses pure sine waves. If you want to add harmonics, that would be sweet.
  
* Make a Python Version
  MATLAB is great, but it requires a license. If you have a bit of Python under your belt,
  consider translating this to Python. Idk about you, but that is totally an evening well spent :) 

* Use it!
  Introduce your friends to VocalWarmup! It will make you a better musician, no matter what 
  your instrument.
